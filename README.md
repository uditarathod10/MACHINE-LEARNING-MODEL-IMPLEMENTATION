DESCRIPTION 

MACHINE LEARNING MODEL IMPLEMENTATION
Implement a machine learning model using Python and scikit-learn to classify iris flowers into three species based on their petal and sepal measurements. The goal is to develop an accurate classifier using a Random Forest model.

 Objectives:
Load and explore the Iris dataset

Preprocess and scale the data using StandardScaler

Train a RandomForestClassifier on the training set

Evaluate the model using accuracy and a classification report

Expected Outcome:
A trained classification model that achieves high accuracy on the test data

Well-structured and readable Python code

Basic evaluation metrics printed to the console

 Technical Requirements:
Python 3.x

Libraries:

numpy

pandas

scikit-learn (for preprocessing, training, and evaluation)
